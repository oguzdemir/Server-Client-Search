/*
*	OÄŸuz Demir 21201712 CS342-1
*	Project2- server file
*	Takes request from clients and create a child process for each request.
*	In multi threaded manner, it opens given files and finds the matched words.
*	Result is given back to the client. In communication, POSIX message queues are used.
*
*	To implement pthread functions, definitions are taken from lecture slides. 
*	Global variables are used for communication between threads.
*	For usage of message queues, manual of posix message queues (given in piazza),ubuntuforums and gnu.org is used.
*	I also researched for examples of usage of message queues.
